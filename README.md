# MEP -  Middle Europe Productions alpha v1.3.1

Following library is a header only environment which does not need to be build.
The only requirement is linking the MEP file to the environment in which you work is addition to that you do need to setup SFML. Furthermore if you want to receive full MEP experience you do need to download SFML, replace the files from the `SFML_2.5.1_Changes` and build the SFML by yourself. 

##### Keep in mind that I do not own any rights to the files in the `SFML_2.5.1_Changes`. 
All of the changes are marked in the following way:
/// <MEP Modification>
Implementation
/// </MEP Modification>
